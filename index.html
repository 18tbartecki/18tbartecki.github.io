				</p>
				<p class="description">Last semester I worked on a machine learning project investigating the relationship between the occurrence of natural disasters and the volume of Tweets that mentioned climate change before and after the event. My goal was to see if Tweets spiked during the disasters and whether or not they quickly died out following them.
					<br><br>
					To investigate, I hydrated over 5 million Tweets mentioning climate change to track frequency relative to major climatic world events. After amassing this data and correlating it with events I could find in news articles, I translated it onto a Tableau map for better analysis. As a result of this analysis, I wrote a paper arguing machine learning is an absolute necessity to combat climate change moving forward, especially in vulnerable areas. You can read my paper along with my analysis <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qeLYy82-Ghqqp8q_k7tRYwxrUjMQAvJ4/view?usp=sharing">here</a>. </p>

While there were 3 levels of permissions, base users were able to create an account with a favorites list and observe the AQI, Environmental Quality score, and worst current pollutant across 100 different cities.
					<br><br>
					To accomplish this I worked with the AirVisual and Teleport Public APIs to gather real-time data. With this data, I monitored trends in the AQI and QOL over time to analyze fluctuations and explore the potential connection between the two.
